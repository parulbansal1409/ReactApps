# The Hangman Game

## Game Rules - Create the hangman game using the following game rules:

## Play individually.

## Have the user select a letter of the alphabet.

## If the letter is contained in the word, the user takes another turn guessing a letter## To reveal a letter (depending on which slide template is used), either: Click on the letter in the alphabet area which will then trigger the letter to be revealed if it is contained in the word/phrase.Either if the letter is contained or not on the word removed from the alphabet.

## If the letter is not contained in the word, a portion of the hangman is added.

## The game continues until:

## the word is guessed (all letters are revealed) – WINNER or,

## all the parts of the hangman are displayed – LOSER

## The user has 100 seconds to place a letter
